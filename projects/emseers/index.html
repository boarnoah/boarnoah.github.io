<span><b>Description:</b></span>
<p>
Started out as a group YouTube channel by Ahmed Ashkir, Arvind Suresh and myself.
Our initial goals were primarily focused around making MineCraft machinima videos.
</p>
<p>
It has since evolved into sort of a catchall grouping for any sort of project that
we undertake together.

The current future objectives, for me (in order of priority):
</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
<li>Prototype d2_payload, TF2's Payload gamemode in Dota 2</li>
<li>Prototype for <a href="https://github.com/boarnoah/hxp_plane">hxp_plane</a>, a top down TBS</li>
<li>Rework <a href="https://emseers.github.io">emseers.github.io</a>, responsive mobile friendly design
and improved blog support</li>
</ul>
