<span><b>Description:</b></span>
<p>
Rudimentary SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) robot,
using an IR range finder on a swivel to navigate around a room as a school
project (Grade 12).
</p>
<p>
The sensor had issues producing any sort of fine consistent values. Therefore the
ranges were set as low, medium high for four 20&#176 "windows". The robot then
aligned itself in the direction with the highest readout (randomizing if there
was multiple) and travelled this direction for one second.

<p>Following an accident involving a weird looking power supply bus on a breadboard
(seriously, why didn't it have markings!)This shorted out one of the drive motors
days before the final demonstration. I ended up going with the prototype design
(just the head of the robot) with a 7 segment display and used this as a proof of
concept for the project</p>
