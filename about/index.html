<p>Hello there I'm Adipa Wijayathilaka (hence the website title) and this is my personal website.</p>
<p>I hope to contribute in a meaningful way to making the world a better place, undecided as to how</p>
<br>
I'm a software developer by trade, there is nothing as cool as seeing other people enjoy
(hopefully!) something that you've been a part of making.
</p>
<p>
My online handle is boarnoah, if you do see a boarnoah out in the wild it's probably me. In my
free time I like to draw and join the excellent folks over at Folk ARPS for some Arma on the weekends.
</p>
<p>Have a nice day</p>
